# Correlation_analyzer

- Hi! I am Somil Gurnani from IITD presenting my code for correlation analyzer.

Follow the steps:
- Download the code and the data provided.
- Change the folder path in the code to the downloads of your PC.
- Run the code.

You will see three outputs as the goal of the assignment.

I have not used yfinance as asking for multiple tickers in short time might result in blocking. I have downloaded the data separately.
